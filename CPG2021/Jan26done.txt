============================
Last time, we have learned:
============================
* Autolab: L000 walkthrough (Not counting toward your final scores)

============	
Today:
============
* Address student's frustration
** How to see feedback
	--> Autograder feedback
	--> Instructor/TA feedback (see L000 TK ver 7 Q6)
** 0. Cannot see the course
	--> added 4 more students to the course. That should do it.
** 1. Some have trouble making tar file.
	--> use 7-zip (See https://classroom.google.com/c/MjQ5ODE3NTM2ODE4/p/MjU5MDcwMjIwMjQw/details)
	--> still have an issue?
		--> may try deleting the winrar (if you have one)
** 2. Some sent it to a wrong assessment.
	--> take it easy
	--> L000 due date is extended to 8pm on Sat Jan 30th. 
** 3. Some used incorrect filenames:
	--> E.g., Q1.txt.txt. It has to be Q1.txt.
	--> command line: ren Q1.txt.txt Q1.txt
** 4. As I addressed, the answer has extra empty lines.
	--> L000/extraSpace.png
** 5. The answer has typo.
	--> L000/typo.png
** 6. The last program P8 has to take an input from a user.
	--> show P8
* Autolab: L001 warm-up (counting for your final scores)
	* This has been announced.
	* L001 is also due 8pm on Sat Jan 30th. 

* declaration (revised)
	int x;
	int y;
	vs
	int x, y;
* variable initialization
	int x;
	x = 0;
	int x = 0;
* cin / multiple variables (revised)
	cin >> x;
	cin >> y;
	vs
	cin >> x >> y;
* expression (revised)
	See common operators: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/expressions
	arithmetic operations: +, -, * /, %
	23 / 10 			vs 	23 % 10			vs 	23/10.0
	integer division: quotient	vs 	modulo: remainder		vs 	fp division

* Denomination Break Down Problem: break down money into multiple denomination of banknotes and coins 

    // To simplify the problem, we only do it for an amount of multiple of 100
    // (1) First thing of solving a problem is to understand it.
    // "Understand it first, solve it later!!!

    // Example: 
    // 4200 Baht --> 4 x Tho + 0 x Fiv + 2 x One
    // 700 Baht --> 0 x Tho + 1 x Fiv + 2 x One
	// * Tho = a number of 1000B bills
	// * Fiv = a number of 500B bills
	// * One = a number of 100B bills

    int money;
    int tho, fiv, one; // # of bills of each denomination.
    int remainder;

    money = 3800;
    tho = money / 1000;
    remainder = money % 1000;

    fiv = remainder / 500;
    remainder = remainder % 500;

    cout << "Money: " << money << endl;
    cout << " * 1000-bill: " << tho << endl;
    cout << " * 500-bill: " << fiv << endl;

    cout << " * remainder: " << remainder << endl;
	
	// Time's up!

* Denomination Break Down Problem (to finish up)

* Debugging a program

* Float
	type casting:
		https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/keyword/float
		https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/explicit_cast 
		http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/typecasting/
	y = float(x)/5; 	vs 	y = x/5.0		vs 	y = x/5;		vs 	y = float(x/5)

	#include <iomanip>
	cout << setprecision(n)
	cout << fixed
	cout << scientific
	

    float x = 3.33333333333;

    cout << "a: x = " << x << endl;
    cout << "b: x = " << x << setprecision(3) << endl;
    cout << "c: x = " << x << endl;
    cout << "d: x = " << setprecision(5) << x << endl;
    cout << "e: x = " << x << endl;
    cout << "f: x = " << fixed << x << endl;
    cout << "g: x = " << scientific << x << endl;
	
* Example of working on a large problem
	Given R baht/unit, how much is my electricity bill for running my P-watt A/C for H hours?
	Note: 1 unit = 1000 watt hour.
	* Break it down
	* Start simple and refine
		* try specific problem to get sense of it, then generalize 

* Autolab L002: input/output/assignment

* Limitations of int
* LImitations of float

* Have g++ ready on command line
