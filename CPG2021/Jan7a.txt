System commands
* cd, dir/w, mkdir
# Goal 1: Create and navigate directories
	--> folder GetPrep
		--> folder cpp (done)
		--> folder cpp2


Terminal, Term, Command	
						Windows 			MacOS (Unix)
Goal:					C:\GetPrep 			/home/<user>/GetPrep
Root:					C:\					/
Change directory		cd <target>			cd <target>
Create a directory		mkdir GetPrep 		mkdir GetPrep
See files in the folder	dir/w        		ls
Symbol for path level	\					/

Command prompt / terminal is different from GUI

We can run a program using either GUI
* Double click on the icon. (you know this.)
We also can run a program using a command line.
* type the program name

# Goal 2: run a program from a command prompt
* run program from a command line
	explorer
	start chrome
	notepad
	codeblocks: "c:\Program Files\CodeBlocks"\codeblocks
	
Start file explorer
Windows user:
	type
		explorer

	If you could not get the File Explorer open,
	it may be because of the path issue.
Mac user:
	type
		????
	
For students who could not get File Explorer open,
it is fine.
Just look at what I am doing.

Start a text editor
	Windows: notepad
	Mac: note
	
# Goal 3: Use a text editor and create/edit files
* Creat covid.txt, hello.txt under cpp
* Creat hello.txt under cpp2, 
  make sure that you have a content of cpp2/hello.txt different from cpp/hello.txt

Text Editor --> create/edit a (text) file
	
* notepad (text editor) vs codeblocks (IDE)

cd <path>
Two ways to reference a path
* absolute path
* relative path

To see a file inside a folder
Windows: dir/w
Mac: ls or ls -alt

To see a content of the file.
Windows: type <filename>
	E.g., type covid.txt
Mac: less <filename>
	E.g., less covid.txt

Create more files
We have:
* cpp/covid.txt

We want:
* cpp/hello.txt (anything: Hello cpp)--> Done
* cpp/aloha.txt (anything: Aloha cpp)--> Done
* cpp2/hello.txt (Hello cpp2)--> Done

2 hello.txt files
One under cpp
Another under cpp2

Absolute Path
windows: 
	type C:\GetPrep\cpp\aloha.txt
mac: 
	/home/<user>/GetPrep/cpp/aloha.txt

Relative path
(We are at cpp2)
Windows:
	type ..\cpp\aloha.txt
Mac:
	less ../cpp/aloha.txt
	
Now, we are at cpp2
How to see a content of hello.txt on cpp?

Absolute path
* Start everything from the root

windows:
	type C:\GetPrep\cpp\hello.txt
mac:
	less /home/<user>/GetPrep/cpp/hello.txt


Root
windows: C:\
mas: /

Relative path
* start from where we are

To see where we are at
Windows: see the prompt
Mac: use pwd

Windows:
	type ..\cpp\hello.txt
	
Mac:
	less ../cpp/hello.txt
	

<BREAK> 5 min break

Question:
	If I name a file with a space, how can it do?

Answer:
	To make life easy,
	(1) name our file with english only and (2) no space.
	Anyhow, we can do:
		type "test 2.txt"
		Put the filename inside the double-quotes.

Write our first program
* text file (but for c++, we need to name it with extension .cpp)

# sharp/pound sign/hash tag
: colon
; semi-colon
" double-quote
' single-quote
() brackers (or round brackets)
{} curly brackets
[] square brackers

I will show 3 ways to compile an run our first C++ program.
1. (Primitive way/ Old style / Caveman way)
2. Modern way to develop a program (IDE)
3. Online https://ide.judge0.com/

Caveman style:
* notepad --> write a C++ (source) file
* command line --> compile a source program to an executable program

You might not be able to follow what I am doing
on the command line (yet), because (1) the compiler may not be installed
and (2) the "PATH" has to be worked out.

On notepad, write

#include <iostream>
int main(){
std::cout << "Hello, Covid";
}

Save the file, hello.cpp.
Now, we have hello.cpp
hello.cpp (our program source) --> text file

To make it a real (runable) program
* compile it to a machine code
I'll show you. But, you may be able to replicate
what I am doing now. That is OK.
Once we get to our lab, I can set you up for it.
(You can do it, but it's a little long. And, this is small potential risk of messing up your computer.)

To compile, cpp source file to an executable program

g++ hello.cpp -o hello.exe

g++ is to call a GNU C++ compiler --- program to compile a source file
(text file of C++ program) into a runable program.

Once it is done, we will get hello.exe.
Then, we can run a program by:

hello.exe

A caveman way is shown!!!

hello.exe is a program. It is a machine code. 
(To see its content, powershell's Format-Hex. But, it won't be meaningful for us. It is for machine though.) 

Next time, have your CodeBlocks installed
And, we will go together writing, compiling and running our first program.

Lastly, the lightest way to do it, we can do it online: https://ide.judge0.com/

Issues to work out:
1. MacOS: cannnot creat /GetPrep
	Try to create a folder under /home/user instead
2. MacOS path command
	Try
		pwd
3. Add path, so that notepad can be called from a command line
	In short, notepad.exe is at C:\Windows\System32.
	it is either
	(1) add to C:\Windows\System32 to Windows path
	or (2) call it
		C:\Windows\System32\notepad	
4. System path to allow g++ on command line --> later in lab

Left Over
1. IDE
2. Develop C++ program using Code::Blocks

Mac:
1. You may not be allowed to create /GetPrep
	Then, create /home/you/GetPrep instead.
	(you = your name)
	
2. Create a directory
	mkdir <folder name>
3. See what inside the directory
	ls
4. Change directory also using cd command
	cd <target>
5. path uses /
	E.g., /home/you/GetPrep/cpp
6. root path is /
