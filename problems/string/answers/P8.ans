Life is not a game
not a game to win
not a game to win

but a melange of lessons
lessons to learn
Knowledge will give you power, but character respect
camel who delays the rest
sun will rise

without wisdom is like water in the sand
rules well, so you can break
way to change others' minds is with affection
Failure comes only when we forget our ideals and objectives and principles
Whatever prevents you from doing your work
break the shell to have the almond
great
better to prevent than to heal
talk without being interrupt
we shift.We transform, so we can continue our stories the other place
